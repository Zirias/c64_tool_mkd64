Build and installation instructions for mkd64
=============================================

Quick start
-----------

  just type 'make'.


Complete building instructions
------------------------------

  = Prerequisites =

  For building mkd64, you need a C89-compliant C-Compiler. A Makefile is
  included for building with the GCC C-Compiler and GNU Make. For building
  with Visual Studio, there's also a solution file and some project files.

  = GCC / GNU Make on windows =

  For windows, get a copy of either mingw32 or mingw-w64. Do NOT install msys,
  or at least make sure it is not in your search path. If GNU make finds an
  'sh.exe', it tries to use it for executing the recipes. The provided Makefile
  uses 'cmd.exe' syntax on windows, so this would fail.

  = Building 'portable' binaries =

  THIS IS THE ONLY SUPPORTED OPTION FOR WINDOWS
  'make' without any options will build a portable version, that means, mkd64
  will look for modules in its own directory. So you can just place mkd64
  and all modules (*.so / *.dll) in a directory together and no installation
  is required.

  = Building an installable version =

  For building an installable version, provide an installation prefix to make,
  for example:

    make prefix=/usr/local
    make prefix=/usr/local install
  
  This will install mkd64 in ${prefix}/bin and modules in ${prefix}/lib/mkd64

  For packagers: The install target supports a DESTDIR variable, for example:

    make prefix=/usr
    make DESTDIR=/tmp/pkg prefix=/usr install

  = Other make options and targets =

    * stripping:

    Type 'make strip'. For installable builds, this is done by default.

    * debugging:

    'make DEBUG=1' creates a debugging build with verbose output and debugging
    symbols for use with gdb or valgrind. Do a 'make clean' first.

    * i386 builds on linux amd64:

    'make GCC32=1' will build i386 binaries on an amd64 linux system. This
    could work for other multiarch systems, too -- I didn't test it. Do a
    'make clean' first.

  = Debian packages =

  To build your own debian packages, just use

    dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc

  It is possible to build i386 debian packages on an amd64 debian machine like
  this:

    dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc -ai386

  Note that dpkg-buildpackage will look for a tool 'i486-linux-gnu-strip'
  in this case.  A symlink to your normal strip utility  (e.g.
  /usr/local/bin/i486-linux-gnu-strip => /usr/bin/strip) will satisfy this.

  A second package 'mkd64-dev' will be created, containing the public mkd64
  headers for module development.
